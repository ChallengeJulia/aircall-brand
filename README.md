# Aircall brand

## Introduction

A brand platform to showcase the brand voice & assets, both for internal & external purposes. The website is accesible at this URL: https://unruffled-hoover-35ea83.netlify.app/

## Improvements

Possible improvements

- use a gantt chart or timeline to explain project plan
- responsive: more breakpoints
- directly use svg instead of img to allow fill path css property (animation)
- some inconsistent class name 
- better refactor (didnt have time)

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
